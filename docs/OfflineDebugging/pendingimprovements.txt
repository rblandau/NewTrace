* FIXME: HTML output to specify prefix and suffix strings.
Currently only <br/> prefix, but some user might want more.
Probalby leave <br/> as the default if HTML but not otherwise specified.

* FIXME: production mode should permit Y as well as YES.
do getenv(...).upper().startswith("Y") instead of =="YES" currently.

* FIXME: optimize yes/no checking of facility name.
Probably lists or dictionaries of names with 0/1 answers, 
added as they are encountered during run.  
Not very common but might be good anyway. 

* FIXME: thread-safe.
Thread lock anytime state is changed, e.g., printing.

* FIXME: multiprocessor-safe.
Don't know how to guarantee this across operating systems:
Windows, several Linices.
